# Release v0.5.11

## 🎉 App Update: v0.5.11 is Live! Smarter Coaching and Better Metrics

Coach Watts is rolling out our latest update focused on deeper AI intelligence, enhanced reporting, and a fresh look! Get ready for a more intuitive and powerful training experience.

### 🧠 Smarter AI Coaching & Recovery Insights

Our AI engine is now leveraging even more detail from your daily recovery inputs to deliver highly personalized guidance.

- **Deepened Wellness Analysis:** The AI Coach now integrates advanced recovery metrics, specifically **HRV SDNN** (a broader measure of Heart Rate Variability), alongside detailed sleep information when calculating your training recommendations. This means your plan is even more finely tuned to how recovered you _truly_ are.
- **Clearer Recovery Status:** Fitness and Dashboard pages now clearly display your updated recovery metrics and the status of the AI analysis, so you always know when your insights are fresh.
- **Faster Wellness Check-ins:** We've optimized how we process your daily wellness data, speeding up the time it takes for those recovery insights to be analyzed.

### 📊 New Dashboards & Reporting Tools

We've added powerful new filtering capabilities to help you track long-term progress with ease.

- **Year-to-Date (YTD) Filtering!** 🗓️ You can now apply a **YTD filter** across your Performance, Nutrition, and overall Score dashboards. Easily review your metrics from January 1st to today without needing custom date ranges.
- **Recommendations Refined:** Your Training Recommendations dashboard is significantly improved. You can now **sort and filter by category** (e.g., Strength, Endurance, Recovery), making it easier to find the exact guidance you need.
- **Smarter Recommendations Engine:** We've enhanced the core recommendation logic to be smarter about deduplication, ensuring you see fresh, relevant advice.

### ✨ Design Refinements & Clarity

We polished several aspects of the user interface for a cleaner look and better consistency.

- **Dark Mode Consistency:** We’ve given the app a visual refresh, particularly enhancing colors and layout consistency for users who prefer Dark Mode.
- **Clearer Labels:** We standardized the display of your Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric to include **RMSSD clarification**, ensuring greater scientific accuracy and understanding.
- Workout descriptions involving ramp intervals are now labeled more clearly.

### 🛠️ Stability & Reliability Fixes

- **Reliable Loading:** We fixed an issue where some users experienced frustrating chunk loading errors requiring a manual page refresh. The app is now more robust against these hiccups.
- **Perfect Dates:** Corrected minor date formatting inconsistencies across performance charts and dashboards.
- Improved stability for recommendations sorting logic and wellness data saving.

Happy training! 🚴‍♀️💨
