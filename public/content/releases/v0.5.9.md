# Release v0.5.9

## 🎉 Coach Watts v0.5.9 Release: The Smart Coach Upgrade!

We are thrilled to announce our latest release, v0.5.9, which focuses heavily on introducing a brand-new, highly intelligent **Recommendation System** and making our AI Coach smarter, faster, and more transparent.

Here’s what’s new and improved:

---

### 🧠 Smarter AI & Personalized Recommendations

This release brings a dedicated system for deep, actionable training insights, generated instantly based on your performance and goals.

#### 🚀 Brand New Recommendations Page

You now have a dedicated home for advanced coaching advice.

- **Context-Aware Advice:** The AI doesn't just look backward; it integrates your _entire context_—including current training plan details, future planned workouts, heart rate zone distribution, and wellness scores—to provide highly precise and personalized suggestions.
- **Deep Dive Analysis:** View detailed explanations and implementation guides for every recommendation, helping you understand the _why_ behind the suggestion.
- **Integrated with Chat:** Recommendations are seamlessly integrated into the AI Chat system, allowing you to discuss and apply the insights directly with your coach.

#### ✨ Trend Indicators & Analysis

- Dashboard components now include **Trend Indicators** to help you quickly see if key performance metrics are improving or worsening over time.
- We've fixed and backfilled data to ensure core metrics, especially **Aerobic Decoupling**, are calculated correctly and accurately reflected in AI analysis.

### 🛠️ Planning & Workflow Improvements

We've made significant quality-of-life updates to how you manage and interact with your training schedule.

- **🗓️ Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling:** Simply **drag and drop** planned workouts directly on the calendar to reschedule them instantly!
- **External Calendar Fix:** Clearing your future schedule now correctly removes those workouts from your linked external calendars (fixes a known sync issue).
- **Workout Source Tracking:** We now clearly mark workouts that were generated by the Coach Watts AI versus those synced from external sources like Intervals.icu.

### 🗣️ Transparency & Feedback

We believe trust comes from clarity. This release gives you more control and visibility over how the AI is coaching you.

- **Give AI Feedback!** You can now explicitly tell the AI whether its advice, recommendations, or workout generation was helpful or not. Look for the new feedback component on your dashboards and detail pages. Your input makes the coach better for everyone!
- **AI Usage Logs Redesigned:** We’ve moved and redesigned the AI Usage Logs to a dedicated route for clearer transparency on when and how your data is being used to generate coaching insights.
- **Legal Compliance Update:** We’ve updated our onboarding flow and legal policies (Terms of Service and Privacy Policy) to include mandatory consent for health data usage, ensuring we meet the highest standards of user protection.

### ⚙️ Under the Hood

- **Improved Sync Stability:** Resolved several issues to make intervals.icu syncing more robust and consistent, especially for ad-hoc and structured workouts.
- **Performance Optimization:** We’ve optimized data stream fetching to improve the loading speed and responsiveness of charts and calendar views.
- **Foundation Updates:** We've upgraded our core infrastructure, including storage integration and dependencies, for enhanced long-term platform stability and security.
