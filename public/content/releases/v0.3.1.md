## 🔬 Next-Level Workout Analysis

Your activity data is now more insightful than ever, thanks to new algorithms that dissect your performance beyond standard metrics.

*   **Automatic Interval Detection:** We now automatically detect and analyze the specific intervals (laps, efforts) within your workouts. See detailed stats, pacing, and physiological response for every single hard effort!
*   **Advanced Performance Metrics:** Unlock new insights with state-of-the-art metrics, including:
    *   **Fatigue Sensitivity & Recovery Rate:** Understand how quickly you fatigue during efforts and how efficiently you recover afterward.
    *   **Endurance Fade & Stability:** Get clear data on how well you maintain power output and form throughout long sessions.
    *   **Coasting, Decoupling, and Surge Detection:** Pinpoint those moments of inefficiency or powerful bursts within your ride.
*   **Enhanced Workout Timeline:** Our interactive workout chart is much smoother, visually displaying your effort gradient (grade/slope) alongside your power and heart rate data.
*   **Accurate Heart Rate Zones:** We've corrected calculations to ensure your Heart Rate Zone distribution is perfectly accurate.

## 🔗 Seamless Data Integration

Getting your training and wellness data into Coach Watts is now simpler and more comprehensive.

*   **Upload FIT Files Directly!** 📤 Have a raw file from your head unit? You can now manually upload `.fit` files directly to the app for immediate processing and analysis.
*   **Withings Integration (Wellness Data):** Connect your Withings scale and devices to automatically track your weight and wellness metrics, giving the AI coach a complete picture of your health.
*   **Improved Intervals.icu Sync:** Planned workouts from Intervals.icu now sync reliably, and we have implemented better initial syncing logic to ensure all your historical data is imported correctly.

## 📣 Public Workout Sharing

Show off your epic rides or help a friend analyze their efforts without logging in!
